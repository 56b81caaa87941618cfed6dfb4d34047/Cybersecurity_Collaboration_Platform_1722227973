Token swap interface: Similar to the Uniswap app, there could be a simple interface for swapping tokens including an input field for the token you want to sell, an estimated output amount field, and an input field for the token you want to receive. \n\n2. Price chart: A price chart displaying the current price trends of the tokens would be helpful for users to make informed decisions. \n\n3. Transaction history: A transaction history display could show users their past transactions. \n\n4. Exchange rate: The current exchange rate between the two tokens could be displayed prominently. \n\n5. Gas fees: A feature highlighting the gas fees for the swap could be provided as it helps in determining how expensive it would be to make the swap. \n\n6. Wallet connection: A wallet connection could be provided to enable signing of the transactions. \n\nOverall, the UI widget should be user-friendly and easy to use for new users while offering quick access to more complex options for experienced users.",

And of course, don't forget to add your own links to the HREF attribute!",
